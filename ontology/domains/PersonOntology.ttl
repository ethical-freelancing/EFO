#    Annotation - Dropped Terms Documentation
#################################################################

# PersonNickname was nominated but dropped by working group decision 2026-02-19.
# Rationale: CCO already has Nickname (<https://purl.org/cco/ont00000990>) 
# defined as "A Designative Name that is a familiar or humorous substitute for an 
# entity's Proper Name." This is sufficient for person nicknames. Creating 
# PersonNickname as person-specific subclass adds no semantic value since 
# no person-specific axioms are needed. Applications should use CCO Nickname 
# directly. Working group may reconsider if person-specific axioms emerge.

#    General Axioms

# Disjointness between GivenName and FamilyName declared above
